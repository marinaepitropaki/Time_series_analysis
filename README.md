# Time_series_analysis
## Minimum_filtering script
>	Loads one file from the light curve its binned and moved average data file:
* Same as CSV_processing process
* Crops the area of the curve with the eclipse
* Plots the data
* Implements Parabola fitting
* Finds the minimum point from the parabola
* Calculates the O-C value
* Calculates Heliocentric and Baryocentric Julian Day 
* Calculates Heliocentric and Baryocentric Julian Day in the minimum point of the parabola
## Binning_moving_average script
>	Same as CSV_processing script 
* Crops the area of the curve with the eclipse
* Calculations of the Moving average
* Calculations of binning
* Saves These calculations to CSV files
* Plots the data for checking

#### CSV_processing script 
>	Loads the CSV that contains time and flux values for all the reduced from background objects:
> Extracts into array form
> Plots the Time-Intensity diagram for the 3 objects
> Converts and normalize the time array
> Normalizes the objects
> Divides the normalized main object with the comparisons
> Plots the above to visualize one phase of the eclipse of the object

###this is a change
